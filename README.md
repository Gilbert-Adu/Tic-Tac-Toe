# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is code for the game, tic-tac-toe.
It's written with the JavaScript framework, React. 

My program has four files: App.js, Board.js, Square.js and Game.js

# Square.js
This file handles the squares of the game. The squares are created as small buttons and manipulated with 
the help of CSS to increase their sizes.

# Board.js
This regulates actions performed on each particular square and updates the state of the game.

# Game.js
This is the file which serves as a docking point for the React components created in Square.js and Board.js

# App.js
This file also serves as a docking point for the entire game.

# eclipse.css
This is some short code to handle the Squares of the game.
